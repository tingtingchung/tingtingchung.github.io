# Ways I've used Claude Code for productivity #  
1. Website migration
   Claude Code migrated my 20+ years-old and increasingly convoluted WordPress website (that's cluttered with ads and that I no longer want to maintain) to github.io in less than one hour. This is a chore I have wanted to complete for years, but never actually took the time to make it happen. Not only did Claude copy the website beautifully and successfully, but it also analyzed my CV and updated the relevant pages automatically in total perfection, all while I made dumplings for Chinese New Year! I also asked Claude Code to help me redirect my domain name to the github.io page. Not only was everything so easy with Claude's instructions, Claude also voluntarily ran a bunch of tests to make sure everything was set up correctly without me asking!
